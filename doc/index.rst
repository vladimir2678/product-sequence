In Odoo products normally only have a name.
You can use this module for assigning a clear reference to a product.

Start by defining a sequence in the Settings menu:

    **Technical > Sequences & Identifiers > Sequences**

Create a new sequence and select the Sequence Type "Product". Fill in a fitting Name like "Product".
Enter a prefix in order to have an unambiguous reference.

A reference like this can also be set on a partner. Look for the Onestein module for this in the Apps store.
